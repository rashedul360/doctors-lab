            The Department of Health under the Ministry of Health and Family
            Welfare of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is
            working to ensure public health services to all levels of
            Bangladesh. The Hospital and Clinic Branch of the Department of
            Health is the regulatory branch of all government hospitals at
            secondary and tertiary level in Bangladesh and all private
            hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centers and blood banks. This branch
            is working towards ensuring quality of healthcare of the mentioned
            healthcare providers by coordinating with other branches of the
            Department of Health and departments of the Ministry of Health and
            Family Welfare keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals
            (SDGs). To this end, the Hospitals and Clinics Branch confirms all
            types of requirements for government hospitals of 100 beds and above
            at district and divisional level within Bangladesh and issues
            licenses and renews licenses to all private hospitals, clinics,
            diagnostic centers and blood banks. This branch is working hard to
            implement the 4th Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Program
            with the help of Line Directors, Program Managers and Deputy
            Managers to implement the operational plan called 'Hospital Service
            Management'.
